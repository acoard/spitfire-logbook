# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Month Year" for DATE is inferred from the note about the logbook being stolen on Jan 4, 1944, as there are no actual flight entries on this page.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS PREVIOUS" are marked as None because the "Totals Brought Forward" row at the top of the page is completely empty. The listed flying times under the note are not explicitly 'brought forward' totals, but rather an approximation of past flying times due to the logbook being stolen.
- TO REVIEWER: The detailed "Totals Carried Forward" for specific flight categories are placed under "OTHER" as the template does not provide dedicated fields for these sub-totals, apart from the single "GRAND TOTAL".

- Right page, top of remarks column: An underlining in RED indicates an operational flight - a mission where action with the enemy was possible.
- Right page, mid-top of remarks column: This "Convoy" was in Part-the Invasion Fleet.
- Left page, next to logbook entry for June 5: 30 mths elapsed from the time I got my pilots "wings" to getting to a squadron - and what could be a more dramatic way of starting on ops' than to fly daily over the tiny beach head where the Allies struggled to get ashore and open up the second front.
- Right page, mid of remarks column: Normandy provided the Beach Head for the invasion on D Day.
- Right page, mid-bottom of remarks column: At our very detailed and comprehensive "briefing" on the morning before the invasion - we were told that the outcome of the war required the armies to get safely ashore at all costs - and (as far as the 2nd Tactical Air Force was concerned) there were enough pilots and aircraft - in close reserve for all squadrons to suffer 90% casualties on the first day - and they'd be fully up to strength and operational pilots and planes on Day 2.

# HUMAN COMMENTS
- Reviewed 2/12/2025, left minor issue below unresolved as not worrying about night hours currently.
- TO REVIEWER: For the logbook entry on June 2, Aircraft No. U, Duty "Convoy PATROL", the transcription lists a time of `1.20`. The original logbook shows `1-20` in the Day Pilot column and `.-40` in the Night Pilot column. This indicates the flight had a night component of 40 minutes, which is not reflected in the transcription's `Time` column for that entry, making the total flight time misrepresented (it should be 2.00, or the night component should be separately noted).

# NOTES
- Top right page: At this time the Squadron had moved from the Orkneys to R.A.F. Station North Weald - north east of London.
- Left column, below year/month: When the squadron left the Orkneys for N. Weald one Spitfire was u/s - and I was left behind to follow on in the Auster. The C.O. at Skeabrea and our Squadron were at Lossiemouth - and I recall the particular sight as our Squadron took off & circled for the last time. 10 tons of twisted metal tissues - the R.A.F's best "dump" came fluttering down - Two or three days later I flew the long way from the South of Britain to rejoin the Squadron - I can't think we had not recorded operations here - since it was not operational. Some pilots did not record operational flights - so that they could stay longer in the Squadron!
- Middle right page, below logbook entries: With vivid recollections of embarkation & a drive back, at Huthra when going to coming back from Bardufoss - I knew the Target area more often. And I recall the C/O's voice on R/T. clear & loud that was a prior experience was particularly spectacular.

# NOTES
- Top right of page: North Weald - a peacetime airfield (Regular RAF Station) was just a low, decent underground (Tube) journey from The flat at 27, Upper Addiso Gdns - off Holland Pk Road. It was here I got my Commission. The Airn Ack Ack. Recruiting officer was a strikingly attractive blonde - I remember, too well. North Weald was definitely my favourite RAF Station.
- Right side of page, next to Nov 27 entry: Gloomy but a clear day was a 1000 Bomber Raid. What devastation.
- Right side of page, next to Nov 29 and 30 entries: These Bomber Escort trips took place in all weather. This day was cloudless the covering flights had a fantastic view of power bombing by ± 1000 bombers But sometimes we never saw the target – God knew where it was by the ack ack aimed at the bombers. I need a comment in a fellow pilot's log book. Even the clouds were red – and fires were raging underneath.....

# NOTES
- Right side of logbook table, opposite logbook entries: My mission was to fly over Brussels at 15000' to relay radio messages from Wing Commander. I passed on a message to abort the operational mission on account of rapid deteriorating weather and though we were No 3 Squadron for home to Dorset for awhile to base. The weather was too bad for bombers and fighters, mission was for Germany. Of the 37 Spitfires in our wing, I was one of only two who made it across the sea back to England. I made it to Bradwell Bay. Flight Commander actually got back to N. World.
- Bottom right of page, below summary box: I think the squadron moved to Bradwell Bay in mid-December. After the luxury and sophistication of our base, Bradwell Bay certainly didn't live up to North Weald. It was a bitterly cold winter and no fuel for the fire. We were billeted in a large country house, I suppose [illegible], in one night to a room, fire in a shared bedroom. My fellow officers were occupying my chest of drawers.

- Right page, next to April 19th entry: With the war in Europe obviously about to end I volunteered for the Far East. Incredibly my application was turned down as I had not given any reason. I then wrote that while there were many tens of thousand British and allied prisoners of war still in Japanese hands I would consider it a disgrace to stay in England.

- Reviewed on 2/25/2025
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The signature below the table on the left (F/LT O.C. B. Flight) is hard to decipher, looks like "S.B. Truba" but could be "S.B. Tsuba".
- TO REVIEWER: The signature below the table on the right (S/LDR O.C. 313 Sqdn.) is largely illegible; I've transcribed it as "[illegible]" but it's very uncertain.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS PREVIOUS - Day Pilot" entry is incorrect. The image shows `466-10` (466.10), while the transcription states `451.00`.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" section is missing entries. The image's "SUMMARY FOR APRIL 1945" box under "TOTAL" includes "Total of Other Types" for Day (283.20) and Night (16.30), which are not present in the transcription. The transcription only lists totals related to Spitfire IX for the month.
- TO REVIEWER: The "GRAND TOTAL: 572.45" entry is contextually inaccurate. The value `572.45` is transcribed correctly from the "GRAND TOTAL [Cols. (1) to (10)]" line at the bottom of the left page, but this represents the *grand total brought forward* from previous pages (i.e., total hours before April's flights), not the final grand total after April's flights have been added. This should be explicitly labeled as "Grand Total Brought Forward" to avoid misunderstanding.

# HUMAN COMMENTS
- Reviewed 12/3/2025
- TO REVIEWER: There is a slight discrepancy between the stated "GRAND TOTAL" (584 Hrs. 35 Mins.) and the sum of the "Totals Carried Forward" (90.20 + 478.05 + 9.50 + 6.20 = 584.00), which is 35 minutes. The Grand Total field was transcribed exactly as written.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Grand Total" is explicitly written as "584 Hrs. 35 Mins." following the provided template instruction "Do NOT modify what's written".

- TO REVIEWER: For the entry on May 17th, the 'Pilot' column in the transcription states "F/O McCracken". In the image, 'Self' is the 1st Pilot (indicated by ditto marks), and "F/O McCracken" is listed in the '2nd Pilot, Pupil or Passenger' column. The transcription should reflect 'Self' as the pilot.
- TO REVIEWER: For the entry on May 17th, the 'Duty' column in the transcription is blank. In the image, "F/O McCracken" is written in the 'Duty' column for this entry.
- TO REVIEWER: In the 'NOTES' section, the transcription states "(-pilot photo Glenthorne -)". The text in the image appears to be "(-photo Gleurthorre-)" or "Gleathorne", which is a visual discrepancy from "Glenthorne".

# HUMAN COMMENTS
- Reviewed 3/12/2025, missing a little but these are just passenger layover flights.
- TO REVIEWER: The 'Time' column in the logbook entries table includes values from the 'PASSENGER' column for most entries, and 'DAY PILOT' for the last entry, as these were the only time values recorded per flight.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS PREVIOUS" section is marked "None" for all categories as the "Totals Brought Forward" in the original logbook only showed a value in the 'PASSENGER' column, which is not part of Day/Night Dual/Pilot. This passenger total is noted in "OTHER".
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" reflects only the Day Pilot time (0.15) and no Night Pilot time, consistent with the specific time columns for the month's entries.
- TO REVIEWER: Several duty descriptions for the first block of entries (Dakota flights) are incorrect or shifted due to the date error and apparent misinterpretation of the multi-leg journey.
- TO REVIEWER: One entry for July 19 (Cucigu, Mauripur, Karachi - Jodhpur) is missing from the transcription. The transcription begins with "Jodhpur - Palam, Delhi" for the first Cucigu flight on July 19, omitting the preceding leg.

- Basically a filler page, no flight hours, nothing much.

- TO REVIEWER: The numerical entries 0.15, 8.40, and 48.15 are on a line explicitly marked as "SUMMARY FOR July 1945". They are treated as monthly totals for Day Pilot and Passenger categories.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Aircraft Type", "Pilot", and "2nd Pilot" (here "202 S.P.") values are associated with this summary line and are therefore included in the 'NOTES' section rather than 'LOGBOOK ENTRIES'.
- TO REVIEWER: "SKATFOR." was transcribed as "SKAYFOR." based on visual inspection.
- TO REVIEWER: "R.A. Glen" signature was confirmed against common transcription errors.
- TO REVIEWER: The 'TOTALS MONTH' section is missing the 'Passenger' total of 48.15, despite the 'NOTES' section correctly identifying 48.15 as a monthly total for the passenger category.

# NOTES
- Right margin next to Aug 11-18 entries: Just a month after arriving in India I "navigated"     a trip via Ranchi - and paid a surprise visit to Aunt Freda at Mesra - the old Binning family home - and after a night with her flew on to Calcutta and visited Frank[?] again!
- Right margin next to Aug 24-26 entries: This trip ended rather disastrously. Flew at zero feet through a monsoon storm and on landing the whole aerodrome was under inches of water. This got into my brakes and I before I finally stopped I'd written off my Lysander, a Beautifighter and seriously damaged a spitfire! Luckily, the war had just finished.
- Right margin below table: My school friend Brian Whitall was in Allahabad and we met at this time.
- Aug 11: Passenger time: 3.00. (Pilot was self for 2.45)

# HUMAN COMMENTS
- Reviewed 3/12/2025, notes are correct, but have not addressed below issues.
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" for Day Pilot (40.60) has been calculated by summing the relevant "Pilot" time columns on this page. This calculated total does not align with the differences between "Totals Carried Forward" and "Totals Brought Forward" values on the logbook page, which suggests the running totals incorporate data from beyond the entries visible on this page.
- TO REVIEWER: Passenger times are noted in the "NOTES" section for entries where both pilot and passenger times were recorded, as the template has a single 'Time' column which was prioritized for pilot time.
- TO REVIEWER: The transcription contains several substantive inaccuracies and transcription errors:
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: Missing "TOTALS PREVIOUS" entries:** The transcription is missing the following "Totals Brought Forward" from the logbook header:
- TO REVIEWER: *   Multi-Engine Day Dual: 8.20
- TO REVIEWER: *   Multi-Engine Day 1st Pilot: 8.40
- TO REVIEWER: *   Passenger: 71.05
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: Incorrect `No.` column transcriptions and missing `Pilot` details:**
- TO REVIEWER: *   For Spitfire XIV entries (August 3, 4), `S/P` is incorrectly placed in the `No.` column. In the logbook, `S/P` refers to "Single Pilot" and is found under the "Pilot or 1st Pilot" column. The `No.` column for these entries is blank.
- TO REVIEWER: *   For Lysander entries (August 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 25, 26), `S/P` is redundantly and incorrectly included in the `No.` column alongside `V9289`. `V9289` is the correct aircraft number, but `S/P` is a pilot classification (found in the "Pilot or 1st Pilot" column in the logbook) and should not be in the `No.` column.
- TO REVIEWER: *   For Ensign entries (August 21), `V.BL` is incorrectly placed in the `No.` column. In the logbook, "V.BL" is part of the "Aircraft Type" description ("Ensign V.BL"). The `No.` column for these entries is blank.
- TO REVIEWER: *   For the Argus entry (August 24), `B/C` is incorrectly placed in the `No.` column. In the logbook, `B/C` appears to be a remark in the "Pilot or 1st Pilot" column, not an aircraft number. The `No.` column for this entry is blank.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: Missing specific pilot/passenger names:**
- TO REVIEWER: *   For August 11 and August 12, the logbook lists `P/O Jones (NAV)` under the "2nd Pilot, Pupil or Passenger" column, which is completely missed in the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: *   For the August 24 Argus entry, the transcription incorrectly lists "self" as the pilot. The logbook explicitly shows `W/O Croucott` as the "Pilot or 1st Pilot" and `W/O Lander` as the "2nd Pilot, Pupil or Passenger", neither of which are captured.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: Incorrect flight times for August 19 entries:**
- TO REVIEWER: *   The entry for August 19 (Ramree - Mawbi) has a time of `.20` (20 minutes) in the logbook, but is transcribed as `None`.
- TO REVIEWER: *   The entry for August 19 (Mawbi - Rangoon, Mingaladon) has a time of `.30` (30 minutes) in the logbook, but is transcribed as `None`.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: Incorrect `TOTALS MONTH - Day Pilot` value:** The transcribed value of `40.60` for "Day Pilot" does not match the sum of all visible "Day Pilot" (Single-Engine and Multi-Engine) flight times on this page, which calculates to `43.00`.

- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The page contains summaries for two months (November and December) and individual flight entries for December. The "DATE" field reflects the month of primary entries.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS PREVIOUS" section only includes "Day Pilot" as it's the only one of the template categories with a value from "Totals Brought Forward". Other "Totals Brought Forward" values (e.g., Passenger time) are noted in "OTHER".
- TO REVIEWER: For December 4th, an aircraft of type 'Dakota' (multi-engine) has its time recorded under the 'Single-Engine Day Pilot' column.
- TO REVIEWER: For December 5th, 7th, 16th, and 31st, "self" is listed as the pilot in the logbook's "Pilot or 1st Pilot" column, but time is recorded in the 'Passenger' column. These flights are transcribed with 0.00 time in the "Time" column, and the remarks are noted under 'NOTES'.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" value (8.45 Day Pilot) is taken from the "Summary for December" line, which does not appear to be a direct sum of the individual pilot flight entries listed on this page for December (which sum to 23.10).# FILENAME: 082.jpg

# HUMAN COMMENTS
- Reviewed 3/12/2025
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Time" column in the LOGBOOK ENTRIES uses the time from either the "Single-Engine Day Pilot" column or the "Passenger" column, depending on which one contained a value for that flight. This was done to fit the single "Time" column in the template.
- TO REVIEWER: The transcription contains the following substantive inaccuracies or missing entries:
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: TOTALS PREVIOUS - Missing Entry:** The "Totals Previous" section is missing the "Passenger" total. The image shows "169-08" under the "Passenger" column for "Totals Brought Forward".
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: LOGBOOK ENTRIES - Incorrect Aircraft Number:** For the Dakota entries (January 7, 9, 26, 27) and the Harvard entry (January 28), the "No." column in the image is blank (indicated by a ditto mark referring to an empty cell above it for the aircraft number). The transcription incorrectly carries over "SM925" or "SM891" for these entries. The "No." column should be blank.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: LOGBOOK ENTRIES - Incorrect Pilot for Passenger Flights:** For the Dakota entries (January 7, 9, 26, 27), the "Pilot or 1st Pilot" column in the image is blank, indicating the logbook holder was a passenger (consistent with the time being in the "Passenger" column). The transcription incorrectly lists "Self" as the pilot for these entries.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: LOGBOOK ENTRIES - "Time" Column Source Discrepancy:** The "HUMAN COMMENTS" state that the "Time" column uses values from either "Single-Engine Day Pilot" or "Passenger" columns. However, for the January 28 entry (Harvard IIB), the time "1.30" is from the "INSTR/CLOUD FLYING Pilot" column (column 13), not from the "Single-Engine Day Pilot" or "Passenger" columns. This is a substantive discrepancy with the stated transcription methodology for the "Time" column.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: TOTALS MONTH - Missing Entry:** The "Totals Month" section is missing the total for "Instr/Cloud Flying Pilot". The image shows "1-30" for this category in the "SUMMARY FOR January" section.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: OTHER - Missing "Totals Carried Forward" Entry:** The "OTHER" section is missing the "Totals Carried Forward" for "Instr/Cloud Flying Pilot". The image shows "1-10" for this category at the bottom of the logbook table (column 13).

- TO REVIEWER: There are discrepancies in the logbook's own summation for total flight hours and totals carried forward compared to the sum of individual entries. I have transcribed the stated totals (e.g., 6.10 for Feb Day Pilot, 3.30 for March SE Day Pilot, 16.15 for March ME 1st Pilot) for the "TOTALS MONTH" and the "GRAND TOTAL" as written.
- TO REVIEWER: For February 7th and 8th, the logbook owner was a passenger for 3.00 and 5.30 hours respectively. For March 5th, 6th, 16th, and 17th, the flights were multi-engine, with the pilot logging 1.45, 2.00, 5.30, and 6.00 hours respectively as 1st Pilot. The "Time" column in the logbook entries reflects the pilot time for the specific flight type or 0.00 if it was passenger time.
