# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Time" column in the LOGBOOK ENTRIES uses the time from either the "Single-Engine Day Pilot" column or the "Passenger" column, depending on which one contained a value for that flight. This was done to fit the single "Time" column in the template.
- TO REVIEWER: The transcription contains the following substantive inaccuracies or missing entries:
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: TOTALS PREVIOUS - Missing Entry:** The "Totals Previous" section is missing the "Passenger" total. The image shows "169-08" under the "Passenger" column for "Totals Brought Forward".
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: LOGBOOK ENTRIES - Incorrect Aircraft Number:** For the Dakota entries (January 7, 9, 26, 27) and the Harvard entry (January 28), the "No." column in the image is blank (indicated by a ditto mark referring to an empty cell above it for the aircraft number). The transcription incorrectly carries over "SM925" or "SM891" for these entries. The "No." column should be blank.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: LOGBOOK ENTRIES - Incorrect Pilot for Passenger Flights:** For the Dakota entries (January 7, 9, 26, 27), the "Pilot or 1st Pilot" column in the image is blank, indicating the logbook holder was a passenger (consistent with the time being in the "Passenger" column). The transcription incorrectly lists "Self" as the pilot for these entries.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: LOGBOOK ENTRIES - "Time" Column Source Discrepancy:** The "HUMAN COMMENTS" state that the "Time" column uses values from either "Single-Engine Day Pilot" or "Passenger" columns. However, for the January 28 entry (Harvard IIB), the time "1.30" is from the "INSTR/CLOUD FLYING Pilot" column (column 13), not from the "Single-Engine Day Pilot" or "Passenger" columns. This is a substantive discrepancy with the stated transcription methodology for the "Time" column.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: TOTALS MONTH - Missing Entry:** The "Totals Month" section is missing the total for "Instr/Cloud Flying Pilot". The image shows "1-30" for this category in the "SUMMARY FOR January" section.
- TO REVIEWER: *   **TO REVIEWER: OTHER - Missing "Totals Carried Forward" Entry:** The "OTHER" section is missing the "Totals Carried Forward" for "Instr/Cloud Flying Pilot". The image shows "1-10" for this category at the bottom of the logbook table (column 13).
