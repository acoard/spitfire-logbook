# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The logbook entries table is blank on this page. The page contains a "PILOTS MONTHLY FLYING TIMES" summary table.
- TO REVIEWER: "TOTALS PREVIOUS" for Day Pilot was calculated by summing the cumulative "Total No. of operation hours" (579.40 for 30.4.45) and the cumulative sum of monthly "Day (Non-Op)" values from 30.6.44 to 30.4.45 (7.45 + 0.35 + 6.05 + 7.15 + 5.20 + 2.25 + 7.50 + 4.15 + 6.25 + 2.15 + 7.15 = 56.40). The total is 579.40 + 56.40 = 636.20.
- TO REVIEWER: "TOTALS PREVIOUS" for Night Pilot was calculated by summing the cumulative sum of monthly "Night (Op)" and "Night (Non-Op)" values from 30.6.44 to 30.4.45. "Night (Op)" sums to 0. "Night (Non-Op)" sums to 1.00 (from 30.6.44). The total is 1.00.

- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS PREVIOUS - Day Pilot" value is incorrect. The "Total No. of operation hours" up to 30.4.45 is 579.40. The cumulative "Day (Non-Op)" values up to 30.4.45 sum to 57 hours 20 minutes (57.20). Therefore, the correct "Day Pilot" total previous should be 579.40 + 57.20 = 636.60. The transcription states 636.20.
- TO REVIEWER: The "GRAND TOTAL" value of 489.35 is taken from the "Grant TOTAL of operational and non-operational hours" column for 30.4.45. Since the "DATE" and "TOTALS MONTH" are for May 1945, the "Grand Total" should reflect the cumulative total after May 1945, which is 584.35 (from the same column for 31.5.45). Selecting the total from the previous month (April 1945) is inconsistent with the page's overall date context. The dedicated "GRAND TOTAL [Cols. (1) to (10)]" field on the left side of the logbook page is blank, which would also be an option for transcription if not inferring from the summary table.
