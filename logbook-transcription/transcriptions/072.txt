# NOTES
- Right page, next to April 16th entry: What a spectacle! Heligoland is a tiny island Fortress in North Sea - and to see it receive everything Bomber Command could dump on it.
- Right page, next to April 19th entry: With the war in Europe obviously about to end I volunteered for the Far East. Incredibly my application was turned down as I had not given any reason. I then wrote that while there were many tens of thousand British and allied prisoners of war still in Japanese hands I would consider it a disgrace to stay in England.

# HUMAN COMMENTS
- Reviewed on 2/25/2025
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The signature below the table on the left (F/LT O.C. B. Flight) is hard to decipher, looks like "S.B. Truba" but could be "S.B. Tsuba".
- TO REVIEWER: The signature below the table on the right (S/LDR O.C. 313 Sqdn.) is largely illegible; I've transcribed it as "[illegible]" but it's very uncertain.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS PREVIOUS - Day Pilot" entry is incorrect. The image shows `466-10` (466.10), while the transcription states `451.00`.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" section is missing entries. The image's "SUMMARY FOR APRIL 1945" box under "TOTAL" includes "Total of Other Types" for Day (283.20) and Night (16.30), which are not present in the transcription. The transcription only lists totals related to Spitfire IX for the month.
- TO REVIEWER: The "GRAND TOTAL: 572.45" entry is contextually inaccurate. The value `572.45` is transcribed correctly from the "GRAND TOTAL [Cols. (1) to (10)]" line at the bottom of the left page, but this represents the *grand total brought forward* from previous pages (i.e., total hours before April's flights), not the final grand total after April's flights have been added. This should be explicitly labeled as "Grand Total Brought Forward" to avoid misunderstanding.
