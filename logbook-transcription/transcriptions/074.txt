- Right side of page, below previous note: A couple of weeks leave - a few days in Morecombe (Transit Camp) - and then I was on my way.

- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The time "1-40" for Night Pilot in "TOTALS MONTH" is taken from the summary block for June, in the "Night" column next to the Day total of "8-55".
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS PREVIOUS" section only includes the "Day Pilot" value as it was the only explicit "Totals Brought Forward" entry for a specific flight type (single engine aircraft) in the main log table. Other categories were not present.
