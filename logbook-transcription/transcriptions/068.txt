# NOTES
- Top right of page: North Weald - a peacetime airfield (Regular RAF Station) was just a low, decent underground (Tube) journey from The flat at 27, Upper Addiso Gdns - off Holland Pk Road. It was here I got my Commission. The Airn Ack Ack. Recruiting officer was a strikingly attractive blonde - I remember, too well. North Weald was definitely my favourite RAF Station.
- Right side of page, next to Nov 27 entry: Gloomy but a clear day was a 1000 Bomber Raid. What devastation.
- Right side of page, next to Nov 29 and 30 entries: These Bomber Escort trips took place in all weather. This day was cloudless the covering flights had a fantastic view of power bombing by ± 1000 bombers But sometimes we never saw the target – God knew where it was by the ack ack aimed at the bombers. I need a comment in a fellow pilot's log book. Even the clouds were red – and fires were raging underneath.....
