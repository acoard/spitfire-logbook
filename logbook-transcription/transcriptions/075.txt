# HUMAN COMMENTS
- Reviewed 3/12/2025, missing a little but these are just passenger layover flights.
- TO REVIEWER: The 'Time' column in the logbook entries table includes values from the 'PASSENGER' column for most entries, and 'DAY PILOT' for the last entry, as these were the only time values recorded per flight.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS PREVIOUS" section is marked "None" for all categories as the "Totals Brought Forward" in the original logbook only showed a value in the 'PASSENGER' column, which is not part of Day/Night Dual/Pilot. This passenger total is noted in "OTHER".
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" reflects only the Day Pilot time (0.15) and no Night Pilot time, consistent with the specific time columns for the month's entries.
- TO REVIEWER: Several duty descriptions for the first block of entries (Dakota flights) are incorrect or shifted due to the date error and apparent misinterpretation of the multi-leg journey.
- TO REVIEWER: One entry for July 19 (Cucigu, Mauripur, Karachi - Jodhpur) is missing from the transcription. The transcription begins with "Jodhpur - Palam, Delhi" for the first Cucigu flight on July 19, omitting the preceding leg.
