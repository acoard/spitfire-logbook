# HUMAN COMMENTS
- Reviewed 3/12/2025
- Basically a filler page, no flight hours, nothing much.
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The numerical entries 0.15, 8.40, and 48.15 are on a line explicitly marked as "SUMMARY FOR July 1945". They are treated as monthly totals for Day Pilot and Passenger categories.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Aircraft Type", "Pilot", and "2nd Pilot" (here "202 S.P.") values are associated with this summary line and are therefore included in the 'NOTES' section rather than 'LOGBOOK ENTRIES'.
- TO REVIEWER: "SKATFOR." was transcribed as "SKAYFOR." based on visual inspection.
- TO REVIEWER: "R.A. Glen" signature was confirmed against common transcription errors.
- TO REVIEWER: The 'TOTALS MONTH' section is missing the 'Passenger' total of 48.15, despite the 'NOTES' section correctly identifying 48.15 as a monthly total for the passenger category.
- TO REVIEWER: The 'Aircraft Type' on the summary line in the 'NOTES' section is transcribed as 'SKAYFOR.' but appears to be 'SKAFOR.' in the image.
