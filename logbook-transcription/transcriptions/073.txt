# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: There is a slight discrepancy between the stated "GRAND TOTAL" (584 Hrs. 35 Mins.) and the sum of the "Totals Carried Forward" (90.20 + 478.05 + 9.50 + 6.20 = 584.00), which is 35 minutes. The Grand Total field was transcribed exactly as written.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Grand Total" is explicitly written as "584 Hrs. 35 Mins." following the provided template instruction "Do NOT modify what's written".

- TO REVIEWER: For the entry on May 17th, the 'Pilot' column in the transcription states "F/O McCracken". In the image, 'Self' is the 1st Pilot (indicated by ditto marks), and "F/O McCracken" is listed in the '2nd Pilot, Pupil or Passenger' column. The transcription should reflect 'Self' as the pilot.
- TO REVIEWER: For the entry on May 17th, the 'Duty' column in the transcription is blank. In the image, "F/O McCracken" is written in the 'Duty' column for this entry.
- TO REVIEWER: In the 'NOTES' section, the transcription states "(-pilot photo Glenthorne -)". The text in the image appears to be "(-photo Gleurthorre-)" or "Gleathorne", which is a visual discrepancy from "Glenthorne".
