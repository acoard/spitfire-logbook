# NOTES
- Top right of page, general note: An underlining in RED indicates an operational flight - a mission where action with the enemy was possible.
- Mid right page next to "Convoy Patrol" (June 2): This "Convoy" was - in part - the Invasion Fleet.
- Mid right page next to "Beach Head Patrol" (June 5): Normandy provided the Beach Head for the Invasion on D-Day.
- Mid right page, general note: At our very detailed and comprehensive "briefing" on the evening before the invasion - we were told that the outcome of the war required the armies to get safely ashore at all costs - and (as far as the 2nd Tactical Air Force was concerned) there were enough pilots and aircraft in close reserve for all squadrons to suffer 90% casualties on the first day - and still be fully up to strength and operational with pilots and planes on Day 2.
- Bottom right page next to "Dive Bombing" (June 17): Against V.1 Rocket launching site - with 500 lb bomb. Spitfire Mk IX was capable of carrying a 1000 lb bomb.
- Bottom right page, below V.1 note: *Also known as "Doodlebug"
- Pilot column (June 5-12): 30 months elapsed from the time I got my pilots' wings to getting to a squadron - and what could be a more dramatic way of starting on 'ops' than to fly daily over the tiny beach head where the Allies struggled to get ashore and open up the Second Front.
