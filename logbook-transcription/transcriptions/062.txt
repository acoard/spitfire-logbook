# NOTES
- Right side, top: An underlining in RED indicates an operational flight - a mission where action with the enemy was possible.
- Right side, below first note: This "Convoy" was - in part - the Invasion Fleet.
- Right side, below second note (June 6th): Memorable provided the briefing for the Invasion on D Day.
- Right side, middle paragraph (June 6th): At our very detailed and comprehensive "briefing" on the morning before the invasion - we were told that the outcome of the war required the armies to get safely ashore at all costs - and (as far as the 2nd Tactical Air Force was concerned) there were enough pilots and aircraft in close reserve for all squadrons to suffer 90% casualties on the first day - and they'd be fully up to strength and operational with pilots and planes on Day 2.
- Left side, below 'Pilot' column (June 6th/7th): 30 months elapsed from the time I got my pilots' wings to getting to a squadron - and what could be a more dramatic way of starting operations than to fly daily over the tiny beach head where the Allies struggled to get ashore and open up the Second front.
- Right side, bottom (June 15th): Attack on V.1 Rocket launching site - with 500 lb bomb (Spitfire MX capable of carrying a 1000 lb bomb)
- Right side, bottom, below previous note: * Also Known as "Doodle bug"
