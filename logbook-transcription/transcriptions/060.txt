# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- The "Totals Month" Day Pilot value (24.75) is derived by summing the "Time" values for Spitfire I & V (11.20) and Hurricane (13.55) from the summary block at the bottom of the page.
- There is a discrepancy between the calculated 'Day Pilot' total (Previous + Month = 226.30 + 24.75 = 251.05) and the 'Totals Carried Forward' Day Pilot value (251.45). The carried forward value is 40 minutes higher.
- The signature "P.A. Clem" is a best guess; the last name is somewhat difficult to discern.
