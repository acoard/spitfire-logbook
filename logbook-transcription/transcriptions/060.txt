# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- There are inconsistencies in the numerical totals as written in the original document:
    - The sum of individual Spitfire pilot flight times (11.25) differs from the "Summary FOR 1 TEU Training" total (11.20).
    - The sum of individual Hurricane pilot flight times (10.05) differs significantly from the "Summary FOR 1 TEU Training" total (13.55).
    - The "Totals Carried Forward - Day Pilot" (251.45) does not match the sum of "Totals Previous - Day Pilot" (226.30) and "Totals Month - Day Pilot" (24.75), which would be 251.05 (a difference of 0.40).
    - The "GRAND TOTAL" (356.25) does not match the sum of all "Totals Carried Forward" columns (90.20 + 251.45 + 9.50 + 4.40 = 355.55) (a difference of 0.70).
- The logbook entry for April 25 is present but has no time recorded in the original document. Transcribed as "None".
- The values ".45" and ".20" were transcribed as "0.45" and "0.20" for consistency.
