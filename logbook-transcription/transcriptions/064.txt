# NOTES
- Right page, July 2nd: The V.1 A.A.F (German show) 700-800 per hour daylight-raids on Caen. The pattern bombing was devastating. So was the ack ack.
- Right page, July 8th: "Just one flight (4 planes) we flew well into occupied France at about 15,000' and dove down for a low level sweep in open formation. At one point we swept across a Luftwaffe airfield and I wiped out the crew of an A.A. post scrambling to train their gun on the leading planes."
