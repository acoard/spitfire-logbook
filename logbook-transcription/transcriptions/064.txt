# NOTES
- Right page, next to the "1.20" time entry (July 2nd): The U.S.A.A.F. Bomber (heavy shower) flew over 2hrs in many daylight raids on Caen. The pattern bombing was devastating - so was the ack ack.
- Right page, next to the "1.25" time entry and an asterisk (July 8th), referring to July 4th: Just one flight. (Pilot F/Lt. [illegible] Masaryk) We flew well into occupied France at about 15.000ft and dove down for a low level sweep in open formation. At one point we swept across an airfield and I wiped out the crew of an A.A. post scrambling to train their gun on the leading planes.
